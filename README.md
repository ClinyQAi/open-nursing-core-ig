# Open Nursing Core FHIR Implementation Guide (ONC-IG)

## Mission
This repository contains the source code for a public, open-source, and internationally applicable set of FHIR profiles that represent the core components of the nursing process. This guide aims to provide a foundational technical implementation for a Minimum Core International Nursing Data Set (MCINDS).

The guide is structured around the universally recognized nursing process: **Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning (Goal), Intervention, and Evaluation (ADPIE).**

## Acknowledgements and Relationship to MCINDS
This project aims to create a public, open-source set of FHIR profiles and technical assets for nursing documentation. The clinical concepts and data models contained herein are inspired by and seek to align with the foundational principles of the Minimum Core International Nursing Data Set (MCINDS), the academic and research work for which is led by Robylin 'Tweetie' Diya.

**Disclaimer:** These assets are a community-driven technical implementation and do not represent the official, endorsed MCINDS standard.
