# About this build
This folder contains the source for the Open Nursing Core IG.
The `docs/` folder is populated with:
- `_config.yml` (for Jekyll)
- `.nojekyll` (to bypass Jekyll processing if needed, though we are using Jekyll for the theme)
- `index.html` (placeholder)
- `assets/css/style.scss` (dummy file to prevent theme errors)
