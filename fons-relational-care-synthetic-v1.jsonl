{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Transcript: Dr. Smith: Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. How are you feeling today? \nMrs. Johnson: I'm okay, but I'm still pretty worried about my diabetes. I feel like I don\u2019t really understand how to manage it. \nDr. Smith: That's completely understandable. Diabetes can be a lot to handle, but I\u2019m here to help you through it. So, first things first, let\u2019s talk about your diet. You want to focus on foods that have a low glycemic index. Have you heard of that before? \nMrs. Johnson: Not really, no. \nDr. Smith: Okay, no problem. Foods with a low glycemic index are digested and absorbed more slowly, which helps maintain your blood sugar levels after meals. This includes whole grains, legumes, and non-starchy vegetables. \nMrs. Johnson: So, I should avoid white bread and things like that? \nDr. Smith: Exactly. White bread, white rice, and sugary snacks can make your blood sugar spike. Aim for whole grain alternatives instead. \nMrs. Johnson: Got it. What about exercise? I hear different things from different people. \nDr. Smith: Exercise is also very important. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, like walking, each week. It'll help improve your insulin sensitivity and lower your blood sugar levels. \nMrs. Johnson: That sounds manageable. What should I do if my blood sugar gets too low? \nDr. Smith: If your blood sugar gets too low, you need to act quickly. Have a small amount of fast-acting carbohydrates, like glucose tablets or juice, and recheck your levels after 15 minutes. If it's still low, have another serving. \nMrs. Johnson: Thank you, Dr. Smith. This is really helpful. \nDr. Smith: You're welcome, Mrs. Johnson.
