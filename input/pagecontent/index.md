### Introduction
The Open Nursing Core Implementation Guide (ONC-IG) provides a foundational, open-source set of FHIR profiles designed to standardize the capture of essential nursing data. This guide is built on the five stages of the nursing process: Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Intervention, and Evaluation (ADPIE).

### Purpose
In an increasingly digital healthcare landscape, it is critical that the unique and vital contributions of nursing are captured in a structured, interoperable, and computable format. This IG aims to provide a vendor-neutral technical standard to ensure nursing's visibility and support the development of safer, more intelligent health IT systems.

### Relationship to MCINDS
This project is inspired by the academic and research work on the Minimum Core International Nursing Data Set (MCINDS). It represents a community-driven effort to translate those foundational principles into a practical, implementable FHIR standard.
